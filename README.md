# component-typography

Provides typography postCSS variables for other components to use.

By using `var(--fontfamily-display)` and `var(--fontfamily-body)`, respectively, you will get a serif (Milo), or a sans-serif font (Halifax), and their respective fallback fonts. By standardizing this we enable future changes to the main sans-serif and serif fonts of the website to be much simpler to perform, besides making it easier to provide font fallbacks.
